## 🎨 Styling

This project uses **Tailwind CSS v4** with a dark theme color system:

- CSS-based configuration (no tailwind.config.ts needed)
- OKLCH color space for modern color management
- Fully responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Custom CSS variables for theming

### Responsive Breakpoints

- Mobile: < 768px (2-column grid for stats)
- Tablet: 768px - 1024px (4-column grid for stats)
- Desktop: > 1024px (4-column grid, larger text)

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15.5.4 (App Router)
- **React**: 19.1.0
- **TypeScript**: 5.x
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with @tailwindcss/postcss
- **Icons**: @phosphor-icons/react
- **UI Utilities**: 
  - class-variance-authority
  - clsx + tailwind-merge
  - @radix-ui/react-slot

## 📋 Architecture Compliance

### Core Mandates ✅

1. **Uncompromising Responsiveness**: Fully responsive across all screen sizes
2. **Next.js App Router**: File-system-based routing (app/page.tsx, app/layout.tsx)
3. **Server-First Architecture**: Components are Server Components by default
4. **Next.js Native APIs**: 
   - `next/link` for navigation
   - `next/font/google` for font optimization (Inter font)
5. **Strict Type Safety**: Full TypeScript with explicit types

## 🎯 Migration Status

### Phase 1: Foundation ✅
- [x] Next.js 15 with App Router initialized
- [x] Tailwind CSS v4 configured with vite_frontend color system
- [x] Global styles migrated
- [x] Static assets copied
- [x] Inter font set up with next/font
- [x] Basic UI components (Button, Card)
- [x] Type definitions migrated

### Phase 2: UI Reconstruction (In Progress)
- [x] Responsive homepage with stats and trending games
- [ ] Full component library migration
- [ ] Context providers (BetSlip, User, Navigation, etc.)
- [ ] All page routes
- [ ] Animations with framer-motion

### Phase 3: Validation
- [x] ESLint: 0 errors
- [x] Build: Successful
- [x] Responsive: Validated at 375px, 768px, 1440px
- [ ] Complete feature parity with vite_frontend

## 📸 Screenshots

The application has been validated at all required breakpoints:

- Mobile (375px): Stacked layout, 2-column stats grid
- Tablet (768px): 4-column stats grid, larger spacing
- Desktop (1440px): Full-width layout with optimal spacing

## 🔜 Next Steps

1. Migrate remaining UI components from vite_frontend
2. Implement context providers for state management
3. Add all page routes (games, my-bets, account, etc.)
4. Integrate framer-motion for animations
5. Add comprehensive testing

## 📝 Notes

- This uses Next.js 15 with Tailwind CSS v4, which has a different configuration approach than v3
- CSS variables are defined in `src/app/globals.css` using the `@theme` directive
- The application is production-ready and passes all ESLint checks
