### Data Flow
1. User selects "Agents" tab → triggers data fetch
2. User changes period → refetches with new period
3. User clicks agent row → expands detailed view
4. All data cached during session for smooth UX

## User Workflow

6. **Expand Details**: Click any agent to see comprehensive analytics
7. **Export Data**: Use CSV/PDF buttons to download reports

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript

const [expandedAgent, setExpandedAgent] = useState<string | null>(null);
const [isLoadingAgents, setIsLoadingAgents] = useState(false);
const [agentPeriod, setAgentPeriod] = useState(30);
```

### Performance Optimizations
- Data fetched only when Agents tab is active
- Expand/collapse uses local state (no re-fetch)
- Period change triggers targeted re-fetch
- Loading states prevent UI jumping

### Accessibility
- Semantic HTML with proper button elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly labels
- Color contrast compliant
- Touch target sizes ≥44px
