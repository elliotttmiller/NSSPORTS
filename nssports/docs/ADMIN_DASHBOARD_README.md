# Client Admin Dashboard

Complete administration interface for sportsbook operators with separate authentication system.

## üéØ Overview

The Client Admin Dashboard is a **completely separate system** from the main betting platform, providing comprehensive management capabilities for:

- **Agent Management** - Create, manage, and monitor agent accounts with configurable limits
- **Player Management** - Direct player registration, supervision, and detailed analytics
- **Balance Oversight** - Unlimited balance adjustment capabilities with full audit trail
- **Reports & Analytics** - Financial reports, agent performance metrics, player analytics
- **System Configuration** - Platform-wide settings and operational parameters
- **Security & Audit** - Comprehensive activity logging and security monitoring

## üîê Authentication

The admin dashboard uses a **separate authentication system** with dedicated login:

- **Endpoint**: `/admin/login`
- **Isolated Sessions**: Admin sessions are completely separate from player sessions
- **JWT-based**: Secure HTTP-only cookies with 8-hour expiration
- **Activity Logging**: All login attempts and admin actions are logged

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Separate Database Models

The admin system uses dedicated Prisma models:

```prisma
- AdminUser       // Admin accounts (superadmin, admin)
- Agent           // Agent accounts with limits and permissions
- Player          // Player accounts managed by agents
- PlayerBet       // Betting activity tracking
- PlayerTransaction // Balance transactions and history
- AgentBalanceLog // Agent adjustment history
- AdminActivityLog // Complete audit trail
```
