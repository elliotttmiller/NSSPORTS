### üí∞ Odds Formats & Calculations

The platform uses **American odds format** (the standard in North American sports betting) with full mathematical precision.

#### **Understanding American Odds**

```
FAVORITES (Negative Numbers):
  -150 = You need to bet $150 to win $100
  -200 = You need to bet $200 to win $100
  -110 = You need to bet $110 to win $100

UNDERDOGS (Positive Numbers):
  +150 = If you bet $100, you win $150
  +200 = If you bet $100, you win $200
  +130 = If you bet $100, you win $130
```

#### **How Payouts Are Calculated**

The system automatically calculates exact payouts based on American odds:

**For Favorites (Negative Odds):**
- Take your stake amount
- Multiply by 100
- Divide by the odds number (without the minus sign)
- Add your original stake back

**For Underdogs (Positive Odds):**
- Take your stake amount
- Multiply by the odds number
- Divide by 100
- Add your original stake back

**Real-World Examples:**

| Your Bet | Odds | What You Risk | What You Win | Total You Get Back |
|:---------|:-----|:--------------|:-------------|:-------------------|
| $100 | -150 | $100 | $66.67 | $166.67 |
| $100 | +150 | $100 | $150.00 | $250.00 |
| $50 | -110 | $50 | $45.45 | $95.45 |
| $200 | +200 | $200 | $400.00 | $600.00 |

### ‚öôÔ∏è Customizable Odds & Juice System

**This is where you have complete control over your business margins.**

#### **What is "Juice" (Vig)?**

In sports betting, the "juice" or "vigorish" (vig) is your built-in profit margin. It's the edge the house takes on each bet.

**Standard Industry Example:**
```
Philadelphia Eagles vs. Dallas Cowboys Spread

WITHOUT JUICE (Theoretical Perfect Market):
  Eagles -3.5    [+100]
  Cowboys +3.5   [+100]

WITH STANDARD JUICE (Real Sportsbook):
  Eagles -3.5    [-110]
  Cowboys +3.5   [-110]
```

In the second example, bettors must risk $110 to win $100 on either side. If equal money comes in on both sides, the sportsbook collects $220 in bets and pays out $210 to winners ($100 profit + $110 stake returned), keeping $10 as profit.

**The juice is your guaranteed profit margin.**

#### **üéõÔ∏è Fully Customizable Juice/Edge Configuration**

Our platform allows you to customize your margins at multiple levels:

#### **üìä Margin Calculation Examples**

**Example 1: Standard Two-Way Market**
```
Game: Lakers vs. Warriors Spread

RAW CONSENSUS LINE:
  Lakers -5.5
  Warriors +5.5

YOUR JUICE SETTING: -110/-110 (Standard)

FINAL DISPLAY TO CUSTOMERS:
  Lakers -5.5    [-110]    (Risk $110 to win $100)
  Warriors +5.5  [-110]    (Risk $110 to win $100)

YOUR EDGE:
  If $110 bet on each side ($220 total action)
  You pay winner: $210 ($100 profit + $110 stake)
  You keep: $10 (4.5% margin)
```

**Example 2: Higher Juice on Props**
```
Prop: LeBron James Points

RAW CONSENSUS LINE:
  Over 25.5 points
  Under 25.5 points

YOUR JUICE SETTING: -120/-120 (Higher margin on props)

FINAL DISPLAY TO CUSTOMERS:
  OVER 25.5   [-120]    (Risk $120 to win $100)
  UNDER 25.5  [-120]    (Risk $120 to win $100)

YOUR EDGE:
  If $120 bet on each side ($240 total action)
  You pay winner: $220 ($100 profit + $120 stake)
  You keep: $20 (8.3% margin)
```

**Change Detection:**

The system intelligently detects what has changed and only updates the specific parts of the screen that need refreshing:

- **Main Game Lines:** When spreads, moneylines, or totals change
- **Player Props:** When individual player odds shift
- **Game Props:** When team-specific or quarter props update
- **Game Status:** When scores update or game status changes

This selective updating means the entire page doesn't reload‚Äîonly the changed odds refresh, creating a smooth, seamless experience.

| **1-6 hours away** | Every 45 seconds | Active betting, regular updates |
| **6-24 hours away** | Every 60 seconds | Moderate activity |
| **1-3 days away** | Every 2 minutes | Lines are stable |
| **More than 3 days** | Every 5 minutes | Very stable, low priority |

#### **Automatic Refresh Triggers**

The system knows when to get fresh data without waiting:

**When Updates Happen Instantly:**

   - Affected games update immediately
   - Anyone viewing that game sees new odds

**Q: What if something breaks or goes wrong?**  
A: All licensing options include technical support. We help resolve issues and ensure your platform stays operational. Additionally, the platform includes error handling and automatic recovery features.

**Q: Can I customize the look and feel?**  
A: Yes. The platform supports branding customization including colors, logos, and styling. Deep structural changes require development work, but visual customization is straightforward.

**Q: How does it handle high traffic during big games?**  
A: NorthStar is built to scale. The platform can handle hundreds of simultaneous users without performance degradation. For very large operations, we can discuss load balancing strategies.

**Q: What happens if the sports data feed goes down?**

### Business Questions

**Q: How quickly can I launch?**  
A: Typical timeline is 1-2 weeks from decision to launch. This includes setup, configuration, testing, and training.

**Q: What are the ongoing costs besides the platform?**
