# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of NorthStar Sports seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### Reporting Process

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to security@nssports.example.com (update with actual email).

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the following information:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Environment Variables**: Never commit sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, or secrets to the repository
2. **Dependencies**: Keep all dependencies up to date and regularly audit for vulnerabilities using `npm audit`
3. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user input on both client and server side
4. **Authentication**: Use secure authentication methods and never store passwords in plain text
5. **CORS**: Properly configure CORS settings for production environments
6. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production
7. **SQL Injection**: Use parameterized queries (Prisma ORM handles this automatically)
8. **XSS Protection**: Sanitize all user-generated content before rendering

### For Users

1. Use strong, unique passwords
2. Enable two-factor authentication when available
3. Keep your browser and operating system up to date
4. Be cautious of phishing attempts
5. Report any suspicious activity immediately

## Security Features

### Current Security Measures

- **Database Security**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM for SQL injection prevention
- **CORS Protection**: Configured CORS middleware for API routes
- **Environment Isolation**: Separate environment configurations for development and production
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript for compile-time type checking
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all API endpoints

### Planned Security Enhancements

- [ ] Add rate limiting for API endpoints
- [ ] Implement authentication and authorization
- [ ] Add request logging and monitoring
- [ ] Set up automated security scanning
- [ ] Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
- [ ] Add API key rotation mechanism
- [ ] Set up intrusion detection

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security bug report, we will:

1. Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions
2. Audit code to find any potential similar problems
3. Prepare fixes for all supported versions
4. Release new security fix versions as soon as possible

## Comments on this Policy

If you have suggestions on how this process could be improved, please submit a pull request or open an issue to discuss.
